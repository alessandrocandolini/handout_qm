   I presume that all of you have already been exposed to some undergraduate
   course in Quantum Mechanics, one that leans heavily on de Broglie waves and
   the Schroedinger equation. I have never thought that this simple wave
   approach was acceptable as a general basis for the whole subject, and I
   intend to move immediately to replace it in your mind by a foundation that
   \emph{is} perfectly general.~\closequote
