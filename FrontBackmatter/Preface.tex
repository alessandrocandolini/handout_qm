There are all sort of books out there about non-relativistic quantum mechanics. 
 Some focus on the physical theory, while others delve deeper into the mathematical intricacies or the philosophical aspects. 
 Certain volumes span across various applicationsâ€”ranging from condensed matter and computational physics to statistical mechanics and nuclear physics. 
 A few lay the groundwork for eventual explorations into relativistic quantum field theory, whereas others shine a spotlight on quantum information, quantum computation, and even the unresolved queries encompassing the foundational interpretation of quantum field theory. This merely scratches the surface of the diversity present.

Attempting to providing a single, detailed, comprehesive account of all the ramification of quantum mechanics is a hopeless task. 
So, any attempt at writing some notes about quantum mechanics will have to make certain design choices about the selection of topics to be presented. 
Inevitably, this involves making subjective choices influenced by personal inclinations and a certain proclivity towards subjects in which the author believes to have better knowledge. 
Yet, beyond these considerations lies an additional layer.
